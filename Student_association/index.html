        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Biodiversity Nexus Student Association is a proposed student association founded in April 2023 by eight students studying zoology, botany, and conservation at the University of Rwanda College of Science and Technology, Nyarugenge Campus. Over time, our association has grown to include a diverse membership of 169 individuals, including students from various disciplines who share an interest in conservation.</p>

        <p>Our mission is to foster a community of passionate students dedicated to preserving and celebrating biodiversity through education, awareness, and sustainable action. We envision a world where students, as environmental stewards, collaborate to safeguard and enhance biodiversity, promoting a harmonious coexistence between humanity and nature.</p>

        <h2>Goals and Targets</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Education and Awareness: We aim to promote understanding of biodiversity through workshops, seminars, and educational programs.</li>
            <li>Conservation Initiatives, Research and Innovation: We will collaborate with local environmental organizations for practical conservation projects, advocating for sustainable practices and policies, supporting student-led research projects on biodiversity conservation, and fostering innovation in biodiversity-related technologies and solutions.</li>
            <li>Community Engagement: We seek to engage with local communities to build understanding and support for biodiversity conservation.</li>
            <li>Networking and Collaboration: We will establish partnerships with other student associations, as well as relevant governmental and non-governmental organizations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Progress Measures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Educational Programs: We plan to conduct a minimum of two educational programs per semester, reaching a target audience of at least 100 students.</li>
            <li>Conservation Projects: Our goal is to initiate and complete at least three on-campus or local biodiversity conservation projects within the academic year.</li>
            <li>Community Involvement and advocacy: Collaboration with at least two local communities on biodiversity-related projects will foster a sense of shared responsibility.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will also advocate for the inclusion of biodiversity-related topics in the academic curriculum. For a detailed list of all our members, please refer to the appendix of this document.</p>
